## About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoaoVML42;
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, innovations and... Games too;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and C;
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on university projects as soon as they appear, but personal projects are also welcomed;
- 📫 How to reach me: for now, I'll keep my account personal. Only chosen people will be able to keep touch;
- 🌎 *For now*, the only human languages on my arsenal are __English__ and __Portuguese__.
